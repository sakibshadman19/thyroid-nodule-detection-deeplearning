# thyroid-nodule-detection-deeplearning

  

<br/>

This repository presents an innovative approach to detect thyroid nodules using two popular deep learning models, ResNet50 and VGG16. Thyroid nodules are abnormal growths that develop within the thyroid gland, and their early detection plays a crucial role in diagnosing thyroid disorders and potential malignancies.

The project leverages the power of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automatically analyze medical images and identify the presence of thyroid nodules. The ResNet50 and VGG16 architectures, known for their exceptional performance in image classification tasks, have been fine-tuned and trained on a comprehensive dataset of thyroid ultrasound images.
